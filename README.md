# INTERLINK — The Ascendii Universe ∞

**Where Systems Embody Wisdom**  
A next-generation crafting protocol that fuses cross-chain economies, probabilistic alchemy, federated AI, and soul-bound effort into a unified economic paradigm.

## Core Principles
- ◆ The separation is illusion — spirit and system unified  
- ◆ Beauty is data — aesthetics as economic signal  
- ◆ Perpetual becoming — nothing is final, no one is fixed  
- ◆ Collaborative intelligence without centralized control

**Status**: 10 Test Cycles Completed • Functional Proof-of-Concept (Nov 2025)
